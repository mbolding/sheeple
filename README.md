Code for measuring pupil diameter after stimulus with red or blue light for addiction project

## 2 Jan 2024 
code modified from the old sheeple code
code was renamed to OpEd and copy was placed on mbolding google drive in projects folder. 
VIs were copied from the HP laptop core i7 pgamlin 
the arduno code was failing because it was the wrong code, so pupilthing3 code was reflashed to the arduino UNO. 
flashing failed because 
  - arduino agent was out of date on the old laptop, also
  - flashing failed unless the big capacitor bridging "reset" and "gnd" was removed. idk... 
everything seems to work now on the new desktop computer, but needs to be tested more. 
started modifying the code to look like the new interface Paul wants
